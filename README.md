# simple-esm

A minimal example of how Node.js ❤️ ESM.

## esm.js

This is a file that's exported as the module's main file. Creates a simple object that uses Node.js's `process.versions` object to log some data + adds a nice message.

## log.js

This is a simple example of how you could import the `esm.js` file and

## package.json

A simple `npm init -y` with the additon of the `type: modules` line.

## What?

I just wanted to build a bare-minimum example of how ESM + Node.js can be used together. Mostly for my own experience, but also hopefully helpful as a good starting point for others to begin to understand.
